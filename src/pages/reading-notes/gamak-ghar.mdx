# Gamak Ghar

![Film Poster](../../images/gamak-ghar.webp)

A story about a home told in three parts, across decades. It made me nostalgic of a childhood home and a time when it was very common for extended families to get together for major events. As time passes and the older members of the family pass away, the familial relationships wither away and we see the house in decay through the film.
