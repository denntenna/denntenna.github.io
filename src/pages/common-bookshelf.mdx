# Common Bookshelf

I am not sure if there's any market for this but I want to make an AirBnb type service for lending and borrowing books in a neighbourhood.

I think it will :
- Allow casual window shopping of curated collections
- Allow book owners to make a small passive income from their book collections
- Create community and relationships in a neighbourhood
