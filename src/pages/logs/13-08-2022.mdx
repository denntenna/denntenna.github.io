- Main Insights wrt gatsby and creating blogs with authors
  - Setup a [wip setup](https://github.com/tattle-made/website/commit/5280aab81432544def4f94c49749fab0937e3163) to create pages for blog, people and projects
  - blogs can be mdx, authors should be json or yaml.
    - the transformer plugins for them will create nodes with the relevant fields being at root level. if i model them as frontmatter in an mdx file, it makes the datastructure very nested and hence hard to link with another field
  - Setting up foreign keys on gatsby via @link directive
    - gatsby @link directive tutorials
      - [detailed blog post](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/gatsby-data-relationships-with-foreign-key-fields/)
