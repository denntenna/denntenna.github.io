# Zig and SDL2

## Bare bones Program

trtl is my first foray into low level systems programming. While zig seems well suited for this, I wanted to use a library that would abstract away low level graphics, audio and input functionality. After a lot of research, I zeroed down on sdl2.

Given my lack of experience in the c ecosystem, even trivial things like linking libraries took me a while to figure out. Given Zig's C interop, I wanted to avoid using any sdl wrappers for zig and figure out how to do this myself.

I was able to setup a barebones zig program which integrates sdl2. I also deliberately avoided using the zig build file to remove that complexity. Will add one as my needs evolve.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const sdl = @cImport({
    @cInclude("SDL.h");
});

pub fn main() void{
    std.debug.print("hi",.{});
    _ = sdl.SDL_Init(sdl.SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
    defer sdl.SDL_Quit();
    const window = sdl.SDL_CreateWindow("trtl", sdl.SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, sdl.SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 166, 166, 0);
    defer sdl.SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    const surface = sdl.SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);

    var quit = false;
    while (!quit) {
        var event: sdl.SDL_Event = undefined;
        while (sdl.SDL_PollEvent(&event) != 0) {
            switch (event.@"type") {
                sdl.SDL_QUIT => {
                    quit = true;
                },
                else => {},
            }
        }
	// Draw a white cross on red background
        _ = sdl.SDL_FillRect(surface, 0, 0xff0000);
        const v = sdl.SDL_Rect{ .x = 33, .y = 66, .w = 100, .h = 34 };
        _ = sdl.SDL_FillRect(surface, &v, 0xffffff);
        const h = sdl.SDL_Rect{ .x = 66, .y = 33, .w = 34, .h = 100 };
        _ = sdl.SDL_FillRect(surface, &h, 0xffffff);
        _ = sdl.SDL_UpdateWindowSurface(window);
    }
}
```

## Compiling Notes

- command : `zig build-exe main.zig -OReleaseSmall -fstrip $(pkg-config --libs --cflags sdl2) -lc`
- lc links libc
- pkg-config helps get include path for sdl2
- `-fstrip` parameter of build-exe omits debug symbols from the output of pkg-config
