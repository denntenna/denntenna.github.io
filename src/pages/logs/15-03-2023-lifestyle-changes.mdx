## Lifestyle Changes wrt fitness

- Eliminate snacking in the evening
  - I have begun eating the food cooked for breakfast at 5 pm. This has made it very easy to not snack unhealthy food after 5. So far its working well. I do feel a bit hungry around 11 am but it feels preposterous to order and binge on oily snacks at 11 am. If this works out for me I'd be very proud of this hack.
- Going out for a 1 hour walk in my park
  - This ensures that I burn some calories everyday. Even if i miss going to the gym or swimming, I stay guilt-free because I probably burnt 300 calories by walking
- Keeping Calorie intake more or less the same
  - I am not dropping any calories. I've increased my workout and I don't want to be famished all day. Will review after a month if i need to control regular diet itself.
    - Portion control might not work for me. If i'm hungry after lunch of dinner I end up overeating unhealthy snacks like biscuits, namkeen or chips from my pantry.
- Curbing my Cravings
  - Right after the morning walk I have an apple or guava. Sometimes I have unsweetened instant coffee. This kills my appetite till noon. I took salt out of guava and was surprisingly not bothered by the lack of it. Turns out I can enjoy guava as is.
  - Between noon to 5, if I feel like snacking, I just grab a almonds, acorn. This is probably not unhealthy. Will review later.
- Swimming and Strength Training
  - I think I can do 2 days of swimming and 2 days of strength training per week easily. I'd like to bring it to at least 3 days of strength training so I can target my Core, Upper Body and Lower body every week. With swimming I am a bit torn, since i love it so much and want to get better at it, I feel like I should at least go for it 3 times a day. The swimming pool is not very close to my house so that adds a level of friction to be able to sustain this over long term.
  - For a change I'm going to give strength training a chance. I am still a bit vary of it being able to keep me mentally stimulated to continue going to the gym for. Off lately I have been pushing myself to lift more weight than my body can handle. Especially with Lat Pull Downs and Seated Leg Press, I've been feeling some kind of endorphin rush and satisfaction that I suspect might keep me from falling off for now.
